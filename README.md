Advanced CSS Portfolio

Description
    This repository houses the HTMl and CSS for my student Portfolio. The challenge of this assignment was to create a portfolio from the ground up, first writing the html and then styling it with CSS. The goal was to use the knowledge of the past weeks and create a working portfolio so as to both, apply the learned skills, and to help make students succeed in the future endeavors.

    The project began with the writing and creation of the html. After the base html was applied, then the CSS was added onto it in order to provide the style of the page. The CSS was altered (as was the html) while the project continued in order to maintain and help structure the whole page together. 

    The use of online web tool such as DevTools on Chrome (as well as MDN and W3) were used to help facilitate the creation of the portfolio. These tools help to better improve, as well as understand, the portfolio as it was being designed.

    A note to take is that, the portfolio is linked to the required links, such that is scrolls properly to the correct section, as well as the contact me section linking to the proper areas (minus the twitter and spotify section due to me not having accounts on either of those). The only thing that wasn't linked was the first application, due to me having no application (unless counting this one) to reference. Also no description or picture of me are present. These fields will be filled out in the future.
